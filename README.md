# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains solutions from various competitive programming platforms, including **Codeforces**, **LeetCode**, and **CSES**. The solutions are well-organized by platform and further divided into topics for better accessibility and clarity.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

### Platform-Based Directories
Each platform has its own dedicated directory, such as:
- `Codeforces/`
- `LeetCode/`
- `CSES/`

### Topic-Based Subdirectories
Within each platform directory, solutions are grouped by topics, including but not limited to:
- **Number Theory**
- **Graph Theory**
- **Sorting**
- **Strings**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Data Structures**
- **And More**

## Features
- **Language**: Most of the solutions are written in **C++** for its performance and library support in competitive programming.
- **Optimized Solutions**: Emphasis on writing efficient and optimized code to handle large inputs within constraints.
