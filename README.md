# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains solutions from various competitive programming platforms, including **Codeforces**, **LeetCode**, and **CSES**. The solutions are well-organized by platform and further divided into topics for better accessibility and clarity.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

### Platform-Based Directories
Each platform has its own dedicated directory, such as:
- `Codeforces/`
- `LeetCode/`
- `CSES/`

### Topic-Based Subdirectories
Within each platform directory, solutions are grouped by topics, including but not limited to:
- **Number Theory**: Problems involving prime numbers, modular arithmetic, GCD/LCM, etc.
- **Graph Theory**: Solutions to problems like shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, connected components, and more.
- **Sorting**: Techniques and algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and custom sorting.
- **Strings**: Pattern matching, string manipulations, and advanced string algorithms like KMP and Z-Algorithm.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Classical DP problems such as knapsack, LIS, and matrix chain multiplication.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Problems solvable with a greedy approach.
- **Data Structures**: Usage of advanced structures like segment trees, Fenwick trees, and hash maps.
- **And More**: Other categories based on problem types.

## Features
- **Language**: Most of the solutions are written in **C++** for its performance and library support in competitive programming.
- **Optimized Solutions**: Emphasis on writing efficient and optimized code to handle large inputs within constraints.
